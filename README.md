# Etch-a-Sketch

V 1.00
Made the a basic website, with simple functions to draw with black and rainbow colors.
you can also clear and resize the grid (max 64 squares).

TODO
-basic layout of the website
-think about the main theme of the website (maybe minecraft?)
-make what you draw change the background of the website in some cool way (either multiple smaller images in the BG or make the BG your drawing)
-add color picker option
-add function to draw only when the left button on mouse is pressed
-make the DOM created fully using JS just for practice
-make the website remember which button was pressed before clear or resize
-add some cute pixelart just to flex my art skills(which i don't have i'll copy it from some google image.)
